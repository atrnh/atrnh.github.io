Teaching is a balancing act between a student's working memory
(cognitive load) and the desire to have them reach ambitious learning goals.

<!--more-->

- More cognitive load → less learning
- More things to learn → more cognitive load
- Less things to learn → less cognitive load, *but*
- Less things learned → I haven't done my job as an educator

It's a basic problem of efficacy. How do we maximize a student's ability to
learn something?

*In theory,* all we need to do is make sure students are directing their
cognition at the *right things*:

- Learning goals/key takeaways of that particular lecture/exercise
- Abstract ideas that can be applied outside the domain of the worked example
  (isomorphic knowledge)
- Struggling is good! But difficulties shouldn't be caused by by things that
  are orthogonal to learning goals (poorly written text, vague instructions,
  etc)

Of course, the hard (fun) part is figuring out how to do that.
